## Welcome to Mentor

Mentor is an educational tool (Educational and Pedagogical Designer, Software Architect and main Developer: \copyright; George Eleftherakis) to allow people that are new to programming a machine (with focus on students), to acquire and develop computational thinking skills, building a sound foundation to learn programming languages (emphasis on Java) and know how to program generalised machines. The user is able to control a robot (from the generation of Automata. There will be other generations in future releases.) It always has the name Io (inspired by Greek Mythology) and you can choose its appearance with several predefined images.

Learn and develop computational thinking skills by visiting worlds of fantasy!
